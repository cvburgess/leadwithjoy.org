Mario Kart is a classic party game that packs a lot of chaos into a format that
is incredibly approachable for... well, anyone. The Mario Kart retro brings that
same chaotic-yet-approachable energy to retros which can get often stuck on
autopilot.

## When to run a Mario Kart retro

And to be clear, this idea is not mine, but borrowed from
[Adrien Gu√©ret](https://medium.com/@adriengueret) and adapted for a
remote/hybrid world where a physical board game isn't as easy to execute. Thank
you Adrien for this brilliant idea!

## Running the Playbook

Here's a step-by-step guide to running a Mario Kart retro with your team.

### Key Takeaways

- Everyone that contributed to the sprint / project / milestone is heard
- Limited options for "cards" creates a more nuanced conversation

### Scheduling

Booking these for Friday afternoons or before a team happy hour / team building
time is ideal - especially if you decide to host a Mario Kart tournament
afterwards!

- ‚è∞ ~5m per participant ( + intro / outro time )
- üë©‚Äçüíª Anyone who contributed to the sprint / project / milestone
- üé§ Pick a host who can keep the game fun and running on time

### Prep

Preparing items to share in the retro can be done at the start of the call or in
advance of the call. Because everyone thinks and types at different speeds, I
prefer to post about the retro a few hours before the call and encourage
everyone to come prepared with their items. Being that we are all human and time
is fickle, I also leave five minutes at the beginning of the call for people to
"wrap them up".

**Rules and Limitations**

- Each participant must pick **_exactly 3 items_** to share
- **Max** 2 bananas üçå üçå
- **Max** 2 mushrooms üçÑ üçÑ
- **Max** 1 Super Star ‚≠ê
- **Max** 1 Bob-omb üí£

Picking exactly three items across this category gives a more balanced
perspective of the sprint / project / milestone while also ensuring everyone
shares about the same amount of items.

### Running the retro

> [!TIP]
>
> When crafting a speaking order, consider putting your most vocal contributors
> towards the end to ensure the group doesn't go over time
