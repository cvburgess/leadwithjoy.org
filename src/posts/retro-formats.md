Retros (short for retrospectives) are a way to reflect on sprints, projects, and
milestones, but the way in which a team reflects can leave them feeling
empowered and hopeful for the next one... or push them further into collective
misery and burnout.

This guide is designed to help you keep your retros feeling fresh and
hand-crafted for the moment your team is reflecting upon by choosing a format
that fits.

## When the team is new and still figuring things out

This is one of my favorite times to retro with teams. The point of retro is to
give teams a forum to collectively shape how they want to work, and retro acts
as a natural check-in point where we can keep moving forward or adjust course.

The **Start Stop Continue** format is my favorite for new teams!

It's a very simple format to run, and the action items are as clear as day. By
using verbs as categories rather than adjectives, this format guarantees the
team will think of (and leave with) actionable things they can do to make the
next milestone even better.

The **4Ls** format may also fit here, but it may be _a better fit_...

## When the team is trying new things and iterating

Adopted a new process? Started using a new tool? Retro is the place to talk
about it!

If you are adjusting to change, the **What Went Well / Didn't Go Well** format
is a great way to identify where the pain points are and where the wins are.
Rather than focusing on the change itself, encourage the team to get specific
about which features or workflows are impacting them for better or for worse.

The 4Ls format is also viable here if you want to emphasize the things you
learned or areas in which the tool or process may need to continue to evolve.

Be sure to use _Loathed_ instead of _Lacked_ as the latter is often confused
with _Longed For_.

If you bit off a lot all at once, consider **Start Stop Continue** which is
incredibly actionable and can isolate exactly which levers the team wants to
adjust.

## When the team is frustrated by things outside their of control

Sometimes you can't change what you can't change.

After getting those off your chest with a **Mad Sad Glad** retro, it can be
healthy to shift the energy away from feeling helpless to the powers that be and
instead focus on the little things that brought you joy despite them.

The **Mario Kart** format really shines here, and I find that it encourages
teams to celebrate their wins and shout out their teammates. It's also just fun,
and who doesn't need a little fun when the world feels like it's on fire?

**BONUS POINTS**: Follow the retro with a Mario Kart tournament if you have a
few Nintendo fans on the team!

## When the same few people speak up every retro

This might be a great opportunity to poll (anonymously) your team and see if
anonymity is something they value in their retros. Some teams need it and others
have such high trust levels that they really don't mind having their name on
their items.

If your team is comfortable sharing which things are theirs, you can take
virtually any format and, for each category, ask if people would like to share
theirs - being mindful to call on the people that have not shared in a while.

Otherwise, the **[Mario Kart](mario-kart-retro.md)** format is a fun format to
run, and there are no categories! Each team member goes in order, sharing the
wins and losses from their point of view, ensuring everyone is heard - even if
only for a moment.

When using this format, I often don't set a timer so people do not feel rushed
and save the more vocal contributors for last to ensure that they don't take up
a disproportionate amount of time.

## When emotions are high or people just want to feel heard

Sometimes things don't go your way for any number of reasons.

The **Mad Sad Glad** format is a healthy way to let teams
vocalize their emotions without necessarily generating too many action items.

Yes, I get it. Retro is supposed to be about how you will move forward and get
better, but sometimes you just need to let off a little steam with people who
genuinely understand your experience. If not in retro, these conversations will
happen in DMs or happy hours - they don't just go away. By collectively
processing things and then moving on, the team can feel closure and start fresh
for the next milestone.

When running a retro with this format, keeping the space safe is a balancing
act. Giving people time to speak uninterrupted and acknowledging them is
critical - this is **NOT** the time to negate people's experience or tell them
to "just be positive".

That said, being mindful of emotional "dumping" and ensuring that the forum
stays fairly blameless is also critical for the team's health and morale.

## When the team tackled something new and rose to the occasion

The **4Ls** format shines here because it has a not-so-secret
superpower: _Learned_.

When using this format, I love to remind teams that _Learned_ is not only for
lessons learned but all the neat things that they discovered or figured out
along the way, too!

## When all else fails

The classic **What Went Well / Didn't Go Well** format is the easiest retro
format to run and works in virtually every scenario.

## When the team has retro down to a science

When the team has done a dozen or so retros and the energy in the room is
healthy, supportive, and focused, I like to take my hands off the wheel a bit
and empower the team to own it.

Two ways I do this are by asking for volunteers to host (or by reaching out to
people I know would do a phenomenal job) and by allowing the team to pick their
retro format with a poll.

Slack and Teams (among others) have plugins that allow you to poll your team -
often times you can save the poll for reuse with an automation!

I like to accompany the poll with an explanation of various retro formats so
people feel empowered to pick the most appropriate format for the experience
they had, not just one that they've done before.
