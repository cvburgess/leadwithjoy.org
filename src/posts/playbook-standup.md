description: How to find the most effective format for the challenges your team is facing today

## Introduction

Standup is the most useful meetings on your calendar when done well... or a
dreaded time suck you multitask through. Here's how to adapt your standup for
the challenges your team is facing, today.

> [!NOTE]
> This playbook assumes you already know the basics of running a standup, but you can always check out the [Standup Guide](/) for more in-depth information about the building blocks and philosophy of an awesome standup.

## When you just want a status update

- Don't have a standup.
  - Standup is **NOT** the time to deliver status updates
  - Not for you, not for your boss, not for a project manager... you get the
    point
  - Hopefully you have tools that can tell you the status of the project

## When a project/sprint is getting started

This

## When a deadline is near

## When things are going smoothly

## When things are behind

## When there is chaos outside of the team's control

## When the team's priorities aren't clear

## When the team need to collaborate

## When folks aren't focused on the right things

## When you identify bottlenecks to delivery

Scan the board, is there a particular status that things are getting stuck in?
If so, use the generalized statuses below to get unstuck.

### Ready to Deploy (or some flavor of "get it out the door")

- This is a great time to ask the team to pause new work for a few hours and get
  the accumulated work out the door
- Long term, you may invest in a [release train](/) or continuous deployment to
  remove this completely

### Ready for QA (or some flavor of testing)

- Ask the QA(s) if there is anything preventing them from testing
- Ask the team to rally behind QA and spend the next few hours prioritizing the
  things that would speed them up or unblock them
- If there are large dependencies holding things up, see if there is a way to
  brainstorm with the team to find a path forward with the pieces you have right
  now

### In Code Review

- Ask the team to prioritize code review before writing any new code for the
  next few hours
- Have people share links to their open PRs as they give their updates
- Consider working with the team to establish a routine time for for code review
  if this frequently occurs

### In Progress (or some flavor of "working on it!")

- Ensure priorities are crystal clear to the team, they may be juggling too many
  things because they are not aligned on which of those things matter the most
- Ask teams to "put down" any tickets they have not _actually started_ or work
  they may have hit "pause" on by moving them back to a TODO-style status
  - Many tools will use time in progress to calculate metrics like cycle time
    (how long it took you to do a given task), so ensuring things are _only_ in
    progress when they are _actively_ being worked on can be very important
- If any one person has a lion's share of the work, see if the team can actively
  "load balance" by using standup to take tickets off that person's plate and
  re-assigning them to someone less busy

### TODO

- This may be normal, all work often starts in a TODO state
- As the project or sprint go on, if work is not leaving this status you may
  want to focus on velocity/throughput/burndown with the team to make sure
  everyone can gauge the status of the project
  - Giving smart people the tools they need to adjust their own trajectory is a
    key reason standup exists in the first place
  - Ask the team what can be done to get "back on track"

## When the team could (or could not) use some face time

- Is your team in-person, hybrid, or in a "cameras on" company?
  - The team may be _relieved_ to have a meeting where they don't have to be
    "on"
  - What time is your standup?
    - If your standup is _in the morning_, teams may appreciate an
      **audio-only** format where the only thing that matters is connecting and
      getting down to business
    - Seeing one another is nice, but seeing yourself in a square can also be a
      distraction for many
    - Some might feel pressured to prep their appearance instead of their notes
      or be hesitant to grab a cup of coffee or pace the room - both of which
      often help people absorb information
    - Standup should be about moving the project and team forward, not being
      self-conscious
  - Do you have nero-divergent people or anyone that may be prone to stagefright
    on the call?
    - Having "all eyes on you" may be distracting or intimidating for some
    - For many nero-divergent people, maintaining eye contact can be difficult
      and exhausting
- Is your team fully-remote?
  - If your team doesn't get time to have "water cooler" conversations and
    connect, you may want to ask your team if they'd be excited to "see" each
    other in a cameras-on format once (or more) a week
  - Making it an optional treat the team can look forward to vs a mandatory
    obligation allows the fun to flow in a way that dictatorial regimes could
    never

## When the meeting could use a little more... fun

- Give shoutouts for birthdays, work anniversaries, and wins
- Pick a question to answer alongside each person's update
  - This could be an "ice breaker", a silly would-you-rather, trivia, etc
  - I find the more absurd the better: _"Would you rather have watermelons for
    hands or broccoli for legs?"_
- Start a water-cooler conversation before the call "starts"
  - Pop culture, hobbies, and personal connections are all great
  - Avoid the usual awkward turtles: politics, sex, drugs, controversy, etc
- Play a shared team Spotify playlist at the start and/or end of the call
