## What is the point of standup, anyway?

If you think the point of standup is to figure out what everyone did yesterday
(or plans to do today) you either don't have a project management tool that's
very accurate or you have fallen into the trap of micromanaging.

Standup is your chance to rally the whole team around whatever matters most
_today_ and dig into things holding your team back before they put your
priorities and projects at risk.

#### Some things a good standup can surface

- Is everyone aware of current priorities? Have they changed at all?
- Have any discoveries emerged that we need to discuss and consider?
- Are there any blockers or risks to the project that we can remove right now?
- Is anyone stuck on a ticket, but avoiding saying that they are "blocked"?
- Are there any ways we pair people up to move the whole team faster?

## Come prepared

As the person leading standup you are responsible for setting the tone and
pointing everyone towards the thing that matters most today. This is a great
time to check what work is still open, if there are any tickets getting
stuck/stale, or if any blockers came up that might need to be shared with the
whole team.

If you know there is an issue impacting multiple people on the team, use the
start of standup to address the issue head on and find a path forward.

Encourage participants to come prepared, too! Making a list five minutes before
standup of things you want to bring up can take a lot of pressure off when the
spotlight finds its way to you. Personally, I keep a a running list in my notes
everyday called "standup". You can probably guess exactly what it is: all the
things that come up today that I want to address in tomorrow's standup.

## Pick a format that moves you forward

There is no right way to do standup, but some common formats have emerged that
you can use and make your own - here are three I use often:

### Around the horn

This is how most standups you've been to have probably been run. I do not advise
the use of a horn. One of my teams had an airhorn; I had eardrums. YMMV.

#### How to do it

1. Begin with any direction or updates that impact the whole team
2. Go from person to person for individual updates
3. Each person (or group) gives their update
4. Allow time for others to respond, then move on to the next one
5. Once everyone has given an update, ask if there are any final things before
   the call ends

This format is commonly used by teams of all industries because it works well at
any given time and ensures everyone speaks and feels included. It can also give
teammates an opportunity to advocate for themselves and ask for help which is a
healthy habit to get into. If you don't have anything critical going on, this
tried-and-true format is a great option.

Some drawbacks are that there is no guarantee that all tickets that matter will
be addressed (they rarely do) and it can be easy to walk away from the call with
no clear action items. If your team is up against a deadline, you may want to
focus more on a plan of action than individual status updates.

Other traps include teammates being tempted to say everything is fine or "no
blockers" instead of admitting that they could really use a hand or "passing it
along" to the next person out of habit, making it hard to interject with follow
up questions between speakers. Both of these can have you walking away from
standup with no more clarity than when you started.

### Walk the board

This involves neither walking nor a board, therefore it is more exciting and
mysterious.

#### How to do it

1. Begin with any direction or updates that impact the whole team
2. Share your screen and filter your "board" (project management tool) to show
   the tickets most relevant to your goal
3. Go from right to left (closest to the finish line, first) and ask what it
   would take to move that ticket closer to done
4. Allow time for others to respond, then move on to the next one
5. Once all the tickets have been addressed, ask if there are any final things
   before the call ends

This format is ideal when you are up against a deadline or the end of a sprint.
It allows everyone to see how close (or not) they are from crossing the finish
line and how they can rally to do so. These standups often have tons of action
items and people offering to pair up after the call, both of which result in
tangible progress when it matters most.

Another reason I love walking the board is that it removes the emphasis on _the
people_ and moves it to _the work_, making it much easier to ask for help or
question the status of something without it feeling like a personal attack.

On the flip side, everyone may not need to speak so you run the risk of leaving
them "out" if they don't have a ticket on the board that needs discussion or
anything to add at the end of the call. Also, if there is active work that is
not on the board (red flag, by the way), its easy to overlook.

### Updates and announcements

Sometimes the above formats are overkill and doing something just to do it is a
surefire way to make standup feel lifeless.

So, what if we... don't? Here's your permission slip to not make a mountain out
of a molehill.

#### How to do it

1. Begin with any direction or updates that impact the whole team
2. Ask if there are any final things before the call ends

My teams have often used this format when going through holiday weeks, bug fix
and tech debt cycles, or other short stretches of time where a few key updates
are really all we need.

While some teams might cancel standup, I find keeping the forum is a great way
to keep the team in sync and offer a space for them to coordinate and ask for
code reviews or helping hands.

## Avoiding autopilot and asking the right questions

### Mix it up

Rotate the formats listed above (or add your own) to keep people on their toes
and to find the best way to emphasize what matters most, _today_. If people show
up every day knowing when they are going to speak and (roughly) what they are
going to say, it's really hard to pay attention. Much like when you drive the
same route often, eventually you start to just "arrive" at the destination
without much recollection of the journey. Even if you use the same format for a
while, consider changing up the speaking order or filtering/sorting the board in
a different way.

### Follow it up

After someone gives an update, or especially after a ticket is reviewed in a
Walk the Board-style standup, these questions can help move your team closer to
its goal:

- "What could we do today to move that ticket to [the next status]?"
- "Is there anyone that could help you wrap this up today?"
- "Could we get that open for review by [lunchtime] and could everyone commit to
  reviewing it by [end of day]?"
- "When should we expect to see that move to [the next status]?"

If there is something delicate you want to approach, be sure to follow up with
that person one-on-one after the call. Making people feel bad in front of their
peers is a great way to never have anyone want to join standup again.

## Make it easy to join

My teams have found a lot of success using Slack Huddles and making the video
very much optional - and by that I mean _once in a very blue moon_.

If you see a camera flicker on, it means there's something special going on: a
baby, a dog, a birthday, a remote destination, etc. It's a cute opportunity to
make everyone smile and connect first thing in the morning. Otherwise, we
encourage everyone to worry more about the project at hand and less about
putting on a nice shirt or scarfing down their breakfast before the call.

Many companies have a "cameras on" culture, but standup is _your thing_ and you
can give everyone a little grace (and a lot less hesitation) when joining the
call if you go audio-only.

Perhaps this goes without saying, but makes sure you send out a calendar invite
with a link to join the call. No one wants to enter a passcode or go on a mythic
quest to find the room.

## Make it your own

Done right, standup can go from being a dreaded time sink to a reason you team
gets low-key excited to hop on a call. After all, standup may be the only time
your team has together every day (or at a cadence of your choosing) and as your
team forms bonds, that time will naturally become something everyone looks
forward to. I like to think of standup as the "dinner table" of a
high-performing team: you meet up, talk about your day, and maybe even break
some bread depending on your timezone.

While the tips above will go a long way to making it effective, and your team
dynamic may get people to show up, making standup something fun and unique is
where the real magic happens. _Remember, making things fun will only ever be
possible if you first prove that you value your team's time and that the meeting
itself is worth doing._ Otherwise, you're just buying a confetti cannon for a
pep rally that no one wanted to attend in the first place.

Here are some things I have done over the years: take what works, leave what
doesn't, and add your own!

#### Ways to add some joy to standup

- Playing a shared team Spotify playlist at the start and/or end of the call
- Starting a water-cooler conversation before the call "starts"
	- Pop culture, hobbies, and personal connections are all great
	- Avoid the usual awkward turtles: politics, sex, drugs, controversy, etc
- Picking a question to answer alongside each person's update
	- This could be an "ice breaker", a silly would-you-rather, trivia, etc
- Giving shoutouts for birthdays, work anniversaries, and wins
- Addressing change with the team (hires, fires, pivots, etc)
